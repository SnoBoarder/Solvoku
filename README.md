Sudoku Solver Unity Application

## Sudoku Solver Algorithms
- The following the algorithms considered for the Sudoku Solver:
	- Brute Force Algorithm
	- Backtracking
	- Exact Cover (extends Backtracking)
	- Stochastic search/optimization methods
		- Sounds fun more than efficient since it randomly places numbers into slots and finds "mistakes"
	- Constraint Programming
- NOTE: Must decide on which algorithms to actually program

## Solvoku design
- Display an empty 9x9 grid. Allow user to setup the sudoku problem.
- Have a large "solve" button below the solver.
- Allow the user to "select an algorithm" under the "nerdy stuff" tab.
- Show statistics of how efficient one solver is over another.
- Display the values in another color from the original sudoku problem.
